The-Marvellous-Crab
===================
The Marvellous team proudly present its first game, developed in 48h for the Global Game Jam 2014.

About
=====
Under the sea, one crab wakes up shooting lazers with his eyes, for some reasons the hermit crabs around seems to appreciate when the crab is looking at them. As the crab is too busy dancing to move for the hermit crabs, you have to use the environement to alter the route of the laser. Many optical devices are available to reflect or change the color of the rays.
